MyEasyModel is a piece of statistics and mathematical modeling software created by Arseny Denisov, aka NullBytes0x00.
As of now, it is in very early development, and some features may not work as intended.
Further updates will be added shortly if I'll have enough time.

Required modules to run this software are: sympy, numpy, matplotlib

I'll probably release a compiled .exe version of this software with all the dependencies rather soon.
