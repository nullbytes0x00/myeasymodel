#myeasymodel

MyEasyModel is a free statistics program, licensed under the GPLv3. It was designed to facilitate the construction of models to describe data sets.

Upon the choice of a curve to fit the data by the user, the model represented by the curve is traced across the data, and various statistic measures are
displayed to show how well the curve describes the data.

Currently, this software supports the import of CSV datasets, which are commonly used in finance and economics.


##Usage basics
First, import a CSV dataset by pressing the `Import a file` button.

In order to construct a model, enter a mathematical function into the `Function` field and press the `Plot` button. A model will be constructed, and various statistical
measures indicating its wellness of fit will be displayed.

To copy the results to your clipboard, press `Copy the result`.
